# todomvc-haskell-servant-purescript

not done yet.. lots of stuff to improve:
- lenses (PS)
- add links to README.md and make it sexier.
- cleanup code significantly

This is just an example of a few things I like:
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
- [Haskell's Servant library](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant)
- [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org)
- [PureScript's Halogen library](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen)

pc!
